<li>The mascot for this year's Games - "Vinicius" - is named after the popular Brazilian poet and musician Vinicius de Moraes.<hr>
<li>The host city is named after a river that doesn’t exist.Legend dictates that Portuguese explorers, who landed in present day Rio in January 1502, mistook the iconic bay for the mouth of a river. They proceeded to name the area Rio de Janeiro (“River of January”), which stuck despite being wholly inaccurate.
<hr><li>Rio was also the capital of Brazil.Some mistakenly think Rio is Brazil’s capital, but that honour actually belongs to Brasilia. It hadn’t always been that way: between 1763 and 1960, Rio was top dog (many still consider it the beating heart of Brazil).
